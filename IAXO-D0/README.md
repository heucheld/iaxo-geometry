This is the geometry of the `IAXO-D0` experiment hosted at the University of Zaragoza. This geometry will not be further updated and is kept here as a reference of previous work. All IAXO simulations until December 2019 make use of this geometry.

On November 2020 we implemented an improved veto system with the goal of tagging cosmic neutrons. This geometry mirrors the experimental setup on Zaragoza as of November 2020.
